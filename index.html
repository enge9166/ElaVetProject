                This article is titled “Lack of Support Leads War Veterans into Poverty and Homelessness” and is from the research site Gale. This article focuses on how homelessness veterans are suffering from things like PTSD, trauma, and poverty. One of the statistics provided in the article is,”In March 2002, before Bush stuck the country into the Iraq quagmire, a VA report (VA Programs for Homeless Veterans) stated that ‘one-third of the adult homeless male population and nearly one-quarter (23%) of all homeless adults have served their country in the armed services.’” This shows just how large the population of homeless veterans and those who served is. The statistic illustrates how savere this problem is and answers the question of hoe many servicemen are actually homeless.

                    The source title is “Risk Factors for Homelessness Among US Veterans “ by Ellen Edens. The article is from the National Library of Medicine, a government agency and literary collection. This article details the statistics behind veteran homelessness. The following are statistics that can be found in the article, Veterans make up  12.3% of all homeless adults in the United States but only 9.7% of the total US population. 59% of the veterans in 2020 were sheltered. These are a few statistics among many that pertain to the topic of homelessness. These statistics help shine a light on how veterans make up a surprising portion of the total homeless population despite how few of them there are. Another statistic provided is,” Men made up 91 % of the veteran homeless population.” This shows the disproportional number of men on the streets after their service.
